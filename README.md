# Exploratory Analysis of the Titanic Data Set
## Demographics of Passengers

### Sidenote:
As seemingly one of the few exceptions to the rest of the world population, I have not seen the 1997 movie 'Titanic' and until recent 20 year anniversary of the movie last year, was convinced that scenes like the one above existed purely as a music video and visual backdrop to Celine Dion's song ["My Heart Will Go On"](https://youtu.be/DNyKDI9pn0Q)

## Objective:

Generate clean and elegant visuals that are key to telling a story about demographics of the doomed Titanic passengers.
